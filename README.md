### What is this repository for? ###

An npm packaged [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator that scaffolds a LeadPages Template Authoring Kit.

### How do I get set up a local yeoman (for adding features to the generator)? ###

* Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
* Install yeoman `npm install -g yo generator-leadpages`
  * If error asking for permission: try one or both: 
    - Run `sudo chown -R 'whoami' ~/.npm` to fix the permission issue. (Note: ' around whoami are the grave accent `)
    - If that still doesn't work, try `sudo chown -R 'whoami' /usr/local/lib/node_modules` (Note: ' around whoami are the grave accent `)
	- If that still doesn't work, just add `sudo` in front and enter your password.

### How to run it? ###

* Create a new folder and `cd` into it
* `yo leadpages` and follow the prompts
* Start coding!
